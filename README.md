# addargs

Add dummy, ignored arguments to a function so that an external API accepts it as a callback

## Overview

Callbacks for an external API may specify additional parameters which 
are not needed. Although these can be specified in the function this 
makes its implementation less clear and risks their unexpected use. 
`addargs` functions allows such parameters to be omitted.

For example, the `connect` function in `react-redux` takes a callback 
`mapStateToProps` with the signature (docs)[https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux/blob/master/docs/api.md#connectmapstatetoprops-mapdispatchtoprops-mergeprops-options]:

````
mapStateToProps(state, [ownProps]): stateProps
````

If an implementation of this method only uses `ownProps` this can be enforced as follows:

````
const mapStateToProps = addFirstArg((ownProps) => {
  return {
    someProp: ownProps.someProp,
  };
});
````
